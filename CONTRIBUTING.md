Thank you for your interest in contributing to Webpack Dep Finder! We appreciate your support and contributions to make this tool better for everyone.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16.x or higher recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/webpack-dep-finder.git
    cd webpack-dep-finder
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Link the package globally to use the CLI:

    ```bash
    npm link
    ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Make changes** in the `lib/plugin.js` file or other files as needed.
2. **Test your changes**:

    - Use the provided Webpack configuration file `./test/webpack.config.js` and run the CLI tool to test your changes:

        ```bash
        npx webpack-dep-finder --dependency-pattern "c.js$" --config ./test/webpack.config.js
        ```

    - This command will search for files matching `c.js$` and output the dependency path.

3. **Watch mode**: For continuous development, you can enable Webpackâ€™s watch mode in the test project:

    ```bash
    npx webpack --config ./test/webpack.config.js --watch
    ```
